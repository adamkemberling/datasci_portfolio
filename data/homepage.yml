  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I love creating tools that help reveal changes in the marine world.</strong> My passion is marine science and the dynamic relationships of marine food webs. When I am not visualizing patterns in marine life
    or building software tools to explore climate change, I enjoy exploring the outdoors and enjoying good food with friends. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My area of focus</strong> is using data science tools to communicate scientific discovery. 
    I create value for companies by engineering data-driven messaging for their audiences and delivering a return-on-investment with reproducible workflow solutions. 
    I enjoy building project pipelines, working with stakeholders, and making better decisions with data.
